# R_Statistics_Manual

Welcome to the **CSCN R Statistics manual**. In time, this will become a centralized repository with snippets of code for some of the stuff we do at the [Center for Social and Cognitive Neuroscience - CSCN](http://cscn.uai.cl). Its primary intention is to become an (open) **internal resource** for training, learning and increase our efficiency. As such, **it is bound to be full of inacurate information and horrible bugs**. Use at your own risk, *but do tell us about the horrors you find*.
