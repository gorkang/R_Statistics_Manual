Which ditribution best fits our data.

```{r determine_distribution, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
if(!require('fitdistrplus')) install.packages('fitdistrplus'); library('fitdistrplus')
if(!require('logspline')) install.packages('logspline'); library('logspline')

```


```{r 11-04-Determine_distribution-1}

x <- c(37.50,46.79,48.30,46.04,43.40,39.25,38.49,49.51,40.38,36.98,40.00,
